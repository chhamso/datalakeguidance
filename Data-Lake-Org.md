# 1 Summary  {#summary .list-paragraph}

This document discusses a possible way to organize an Azure Data Lake

The content is based on the different Azure Data Lake implementations
the authors have either witnessed or worked on.

The document focus is on Azure Data Lake. Some discussion of data
movement tools and orchestration tools, specifically Databricks and Data
Factory will be included. Other technologies will only be discussed
briefly. These include SQL DB, SQL DW, Analysis Services, PowerBI, etc.

This document will need to be updated as the features of Azure Data Lake
Store Generation 2 are made generally available.

#  {#section-1 .list-paragraph}

# The philosophy behind the Azure Data Lake organization 

The main drivers behind this approach is to have an Azure Data Lake
setup that support the following:

-   Is as cost-effective as sensible/possible.

-   Do not compromise security.

-   Fits well into a DevOps scenario

-   Have a well-defined path for the information needed to be able to
    support an effective auditing and logging process.

The overall setup looks like this:

![](media/image13.jpg){width="6.5in" height="3.645138888888889in"}

> Figure 1

In the circle we have the different data layers we could use. The data
layer is ingested by some "copy data" mechanism -- shown here as a "Data
Ingestion". On the right side the users can use any appropriate tool to
use data found in the data layer. Also, any new/strange/external/foreign
data can be ingested in to the data layer -- shown as the *innovation
cloud*.

Any development, be it reports as well as applications will live under a
DevOps regime, even the innovative ones, to assure that any object that
needs to be used by a wider crowd of people is handled as a traditional
production object, so that support and maintenance is not *sacrificed*
in this process.

The philosophy is overall to have the appropriate functionality in place
in the different aspects of the setup and not "just" try to make
everything fit in to a relational database.

![](media/image14.jpg){width="6.5in" height="3.203472222222222in"}

> Figure 2

On the left of Figure 2 we have a "*normal*" file storage, that is a
file storage as we know it from the traditional Wintel/Lintel servers
and laptops. This storage can be used in direct connection with a
Windows or Linux based system as it is easy to attach/mount. So,
relating that to an Azure Data Lake setup where we often need a place
where files can be put for easy access, this part of the setup will
serve this purpose as an (often) intermediate storage layer.

In the middle we have the Azure Data Lake storage, which in this setup
is our main storage area. The Azure Data Lake is both the source for any
relational databases and cubes to be implemented as well as a storage
layer that will be used directly by the end-users. The Azure Data Lake
naturally serves as "file system" for the *Hadoops* like Databricks,
HDInsight, Cloudera, Hortonworks etc.

On the right side we have the traditional relational databases, which is
used for mainly two things in this setup. One is to get access to a full
SQL implementation like T-SQL, secondly due to the inherited *Quality
Assurance* provided by the nature of tables -- you can only store things
that the database is designed for -- the relational database provides us
a storage layer for data that needs to be under some kind of *strict
control*. Also on the right side are the *Cubes*.

# Decisions to be made

Every Data Lake has multiple decisions that need to be made to create
standards. Without standards a Data Lake will become a Data Swamp. Below
is a list of decisions that may need to be made to successfully
implement a Data Lake. This document provides context for those
decisions. Many of these decisions should follow from existing policies
and standards within an organization. Below is a non-comprehensive list
of some of the key decisions that should be made explicitly.

1.  Underlying service -- Microsoft recently introduced a new version of
    Data Lake Store, Azure Data Lake Store gen 2. This service is
    tentatively scheduled to enter General Availability in early 2019.
    Choices now are 1) Data Lake gen 2 (public preview), 2) Blob
    storage, and 3) Data Lake gen 1. We strongly recommend not using
    Data Lake gen 1 for new Data Lakes. The choice between Blob and gen
    2 is often made based on volume of data. Gen 2 is based on blob
    storage and it allows you to interface with your data using both
    file system and object storage paradigms.

2.  Data Lake Organization Decisions

    a.  How many Data Lakes

        i.  Separate Lakes for Dev, QA, and Prod or one Lake

        ii. Separate Data Lakes at extremely high organizational level.
            For example, one each for Marketing, Research and
            Development, and Operations. This decision is often
            deferred.

    b.  What are the high-level logical zones of the Data Lake

    c.  What should the File System Hierarchy be?

    d.  What is the file naming convention?

3.  Security Decisions

    a.  Access Control -- Should follow from security policies and
        standards within the organization. Includes best practices
        around groups, users, service principals, tooling for access
        control (Azure Active Directory), and organizational procedures
        and governance.

    b.  Zone, Folder, and file level access and authorization.

    c.  Encryption, customer managed keys or Azure managed keys

4.  Operational Decisions

    a.  Lake Deployment method. Should be driven by, and conform to,
        organization dev/ops methodology and tooling. A typical
        Enterprise standard is use power shell or Azure CLI, with Azure
        resource manager templates from some IDE such as visual studio,
        not the Azure portal.

    b.  Diagnostic and access logging. Often Enterprises have an
        existing tooling solution that Data Lake logging is expected to
        integrate with.

    c.  Associated tooling -- Associated tooling is often driving by the
        Enterprise service catalog with a strong bias towards previous
        approved services and tools.

        i.  Data movement and processing orchestration (Azure Data
            Factory)

        ii. Data movement and processing tools and compute contexts
            (Databricks, SSIS, Integration Run Time)

        iii. Data access tools, including ad hoc data access tools that
             use the Data lake directly

        iv. Non-data lake storage directly related to Data Lake (for
            example for logs)

        v.  Archiving, tooling and processes

    d.  Support model

5.  Governance

    a.  Data Governance

        i.  Metadata management and tooling

    b.  Change control process

# Data Lakes for Dev/Test and Prod

Often there are some discussions regarding how many data lakes you
should implement. We often meet the following scenarios. This document
focuses on scenario B

![](media/image15.jpg){width="6.5in" height="3.4895833333333335in"}

> Figure 3

**Scenario A**: 2 Data Lakes, one for production and one for test/dev
environments. The Data Lake in the production is where the data
ingestion is done. This Data Lake is then mirrored to the dev/test Data
Lake -- mostly as a batch process -- this accomplish the task of having
identical data content for production and dev/test. The databases --
symbolized by the DW identification -- are then ingest with data from
the Data Lake. The Dev/test often serves as failover environment for the
production environment in this case.

**Scenario B**: 1 Data Lake -- serving both the production and dev/test
environment. Data ingestion is done to one place in this Data Lake. Data
that is to be used for production purposes is then transported to a
different area of this Data Lake. And data to be used for dev/test is
also transported to a corresponding area - very often undergoing a
process ensuring anonymization of the content - or some of the content.

**Scenario C**: The same as Scenario A, with the one difference that
each of the Data Lakes has their own data ingestion process, thereby
creating different systems for production and dev/test environment.

The different scenarios have their benefits, so it is important to have
an open discussion about what fits the case in question.

# The internal organization of the Azure Data lake 

As the focus is to use one Data Lake for Dev/Test and Prod the internal
organization of the Data Lake must take care of the requirements of the
different environments

Also, security must be addressed inside the Data Lake itself. This is
discussed in chapter 5.

Figure 4 shows the logical zones discussed in this chapter.

> Figure 4

## Logical Zones

### 5.1.1 The Raw Zone 

Data ingestion is ingested to the Raw Zone as shown on Figure 4. Data
ingestion is done using a Data Gateway approach. This implies that there
are few channels in to the Data Lake. All data that needs to go to the
lake is either brought to the Data Ingestion server/service. Or the Data
Ingestion service pulls data from systems like databases and ftp
servers.

Characteristics of data in the Raw Zone:

-   Storage in native format for any type of data

-   Exact copy from the source

-   Immutable to change

-   Typically append-only

-   History retained indefinitely

-   Extremely limited access to the Raw Data Zone -- no operationalized
    usage

-   Everything downstream from here can be regenerated from raw data

### 5.1.2 The Landing Zone 

Some enterprises choose to use a Landing Zone upstream of the Raw Zone.
A Landing Zone is useful when data quality checks or validation is
required before the data is routed to the Raw Data Zone for retention
(checksums, data coming from 3rd parties etc.) Many enterprises have
some data that lands directly into the RAW zone and other data that
lands in the landing zone.

From the Landing Zone data will go into the Raw Zone. Data does not need
to be persisted in the Landing Zone.

As data in this part of the process will undergo transformations to
suite their end-destination, the Data Lake will provide an area where
these processes can store any intermediate results if needed. This area
is called Work on Figure 4. No data will be "left behind" in this area,
so it is important that the processes either clean up after themselves
or an overall cleaning processes is established.

Also, no end-user access is provided to this area.

### 5.1.3 The Work Zone

Some enterprises will create a Work Zone. This zone is used as an
intermediate zone downstream of the Raw Zone for storage of data that is
no longer raw but not yet fully processed.

### 5.1.3 The Curated (Gold, Publish) Zone

Production data is stored in the area named Publish on Figure 3. This
area is organized in a way that suits end-user access. Often data is
stored on a "per department" level. It is important to notice that if a
common element like a list of products is needed for "all departments",
there will be a copy of this under "each department". Of course, you
could establish a kind of "common department" area, but this is seldom
done in praxis.

All data going to the Publish area is stored as read-only elements. If
needed a read/write area "per department" or "per user" can be
established. This is often the case for the users known as super-users
because they often create things like reports for other users. For some
users that need to add their own data to the data stored in the Publish
area this read/write access can also be appropriate. But overall the
need for read/write areas is often been kept at a minimum level.

### 5.1.4 The Staging Zone

Some enterprises choose to separate the curated data into that used for
"self-service" BI, analytics, reporting, etc. from data used in other
production applications. If so, the zone for data that is ready for
these typically non-BI applications is the staging zone.

### 5.1.5 The dev and test zones

Data that is being used for dev/test environments is stored in dev and
test zones. If there is a copy of the data lake for dev/test purposes
these zones are not needed.

### 5.1.6 The Analytics Sandbox Zone

A workspace for data science and exploratory activities with minimal
governance and standards (purposely undisciplined. Valuable efforts are
"productionized" and "operationalized" to the Curated Data Zone. Not
used for self-service, operationalized, purposes. User level write
access to subset of this zone.

### 5.1.7 The Archive Zone 

â An active archive â Contains aged data offloaded from a data warehouse
or other application â Available for querying when needed (typically
only occasionally)

## File System Hierarchy

The file system hierarchy organizes the data and is central to Azure
Data Lake design. The hierarchy should be straight-forward to use
programmatically and be human readable. Considerations and best
practices in designing a hierarchy include:

-   Ease of data discovery & retrieval -- will one type of structure
    make more sense?

-   Focus on security implications early -- what data redundancy is
    allowed in exchange for security

-   Include data lineage & relevant metadata with the data file itself
    whenever possible (ex: columns indicating source system where the
    data originated, source date, processed date, etc)

-   Include the time element in both the folder structure & the file
    name

-   Be liberal yet disciplined with folder structure (lots of nests are
    ok)

-   Clearly separate out the zones so governance & policies can be
    applied separately

Common parameters used to organize data include:

-   Time Partitioning (Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute)

-   Subject Area

-   Security Boundary (Department, Business Unit, etc.)

-   Downstream Application / Purpose

-   Retention Policy (Temporary, Permanent, Project Lifetime, Legal hold
    period...)

-   Business Impact / Criticality (High, Med, Low, ...)

-   Owner / Steward / SME

-   Probability of Data Access

-   Confidentiality (Public, Internal Only, Supplier Confidential, PII,
    etc)

Of the many possibilities for a file hierarchy one is shown:
![](media/image18.png){width="6.60625in" height="3.14375in"}

Note that the organization is different across two zones. In the Raw
zone Data Source is a partition, a backwards looking partition. In the
Curated Zone a forward-looking partition, Purpose, is at a high level.
Full file paths look like:

/\<Zone\>/\<Subject Area\>/\<Data Source\>/\<Object\>/\<Date
Loaded\>/\<Files(s)\>

/raw/sales/salesforce/customerContacts/2018/01/01/custContact_2018_01_01.txt

/\<Zone\>/\<Purpose\>/\<Type\>/\<Date\>/\<File(s)\>

/curated/salesTrendingAnalysis/summarized/2018/01/salesTrend_2018_01_01.txt

## The Data movement process within the Lake

The processes taking data from the Landing Zone to the Publish and
Analytics areas are mostly ordinary Extract-Transform-Load processes.
Tools for this could be SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS),
Databricks, Hive, etc. Even though such products often work with many
different sources and targets, the only allowed source and target in
this scenario is the Data Lake itself.

If data must travel further from the Publish or Analytics Area the ETL
process often come in play again, but in this case of course there is
only one restriction on source, that is the Data Lake, whereas the
targets can be any storage layer suitable for the end-purpose -- very
often being a relational database working as a Data Warehouse/Data Mart.
The movement process can be orchestrated by Azure Data Factory.

## Archiving 

Data in the Landing Zone can (should) be archived when Data Lake
functionality is no longer required -- please refer to Figure 2.
Archiving can be done to Azure Blob storage The Azure Blob storage
offers four levels of storage: Hot, Warm, Cold, and Archive. Or within
the Lake itself with four levels of storage and geographic redundancy.
Orchestration would be performed by Azure Data Factory

The usual considerations for Archiving data apply. Legal Holds, how
often the data is used, data retention standards, etc.

# The security model of Azure Data Lake 

## Access Control

To be able to handle the processes and structures described in chapter
4, a combination of identities, standard users, groups, superusers, and
service principals are allowed access. On Figure 5 you will find a
typical mapping of these identities to the logical zones.

## ACLs and POSIX

Data Lake supports a superset of POSIX permissions**:** The security
model for Data Lake Gen2 supports ACL and POSIX permissions along with
some extra granularity specific to Data Lake Storage Gen2. Settings may
be configured through admin tools or through frameworks like Hive and
Spark.

## Encryption

## Encryption in Transit

Data in Transit in Azure Data Lake Store is always encrypted by HTTPS.
There is no option to disable this encryption. HTTPS is the only
protocol support by the ADLS REST interfaces.

## Encryption at Rest

Data at Rest in Azure Data Lake Store is on-by-default transparent
encryption. There is no option to disable this encryption. Upon account
creation, a choice is made between service managed keys or customer
managed keys. With either choice, the Master Encryption Key is secured
in Azure Key Vault. All data written to the Azure storage platform is
encrypted through 256-bit [AES
encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard),
one of the strongest block ciphers available. All redundant copies of
data are encrypted and all redundancy options are supported. Storage
Service Encryption is FIPS 140-2 compliant.

## Vnet Service Endpoint (Confirm that this is V2 ready)

Storage accounts, including the Data Lake can be configured to allow
access only from specific Azure Virtual Networks.

By enabling a [Service
Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview)
for Azure Storage within the Virtual Network, traffic is ensured an
optimal route to the Azure Storage service. The identities of the
virtual network and the subnet are also transmitted with each request.
Administrators can subsequently configure network rules for the Storage
account that allow requests to be received from specific subnets in the
Virtual Network. Clients granted access via these network rules must
continue to meet the authorization requirements of the Storage account
to access the data.

# The Data Ingestion process 

![](media/image19.jpg){width="6.5in" height="3.0597222222222222in"}

> Figure 7

The overall principal for data in the Landing Zone is - as discussed -
to store raw data. But to be able to control the ingestion of such raw
data in to the Landing Zone the idea is to have a separate service --
preferable on a dedicated server (on-premise or cloud based) -- that
handles 3 different aspects of this process.

The first part of the process (Figure 7) is a Gatekeeper function. Here
it is controlled whether the process wanting to store data can enter the
Landing Zone. This is often a question about user-access rights
controlled by the Azure AD. An example could be that the Data Ingestion
services provides an ftp-service and the process wanting to ingest data
simply must be able to login to this ftp-service.

When access is granted the second part of the process is to validate
that the data is actually in accordance with what is expected by the
process trying to ingest data. It could be things like file-format,
specific headers etc.

The last part of the data ingestion service -- which is optional -- is
to do some standardization. Even though the overall principal is that
the Landing Zone contains raw data it might be sensible/convenient at
this stage to do some standardization on certain data formats, so that
these objects are easier to use cross different data items (files).

It could be things like conform date formats and time formats (maybe a
split of those) and number formats with a conform decimal separator and
no thousands separator.

On Figure 7 a few examples of services are shown in the "grey box",
which could be used to handle the different functionalities of the Data
Ingestion service.

In the gatekeeper function you will probably use a firewall and the
Azure AD service to control the "login" process.

For the validation process you could use a database's schema/table
functionality to see if the data can actually be inserted. Also, you
might have an ftp service and a file storage for objects that need other
kind of validation.

And for the standardization process you could use Azure Data Factory to
do this in the actual cope process -- or -- if you need a more advanced
process SQL Server Integration Service (SSIS) can be used as a "real"
ETL tool to accomplish this.

# Logging 

You can enable diagnostic logging for the Data Lake to collect data
access audit trails that provides information such as list of users
accessing the data, how frequently the data is accessed, how much data
is stored in the account, etc.

## Enable diagnostic logging for your Data Lake 

![](media/image20.jpg){width="3.0118055555555556in"
height="4.155833333333334in"}Open your Data Lake, and from your Data
Lake blade, click **Settings**, and then click **Diagnostic logs**.

In the **Diagnostics logs** blade, click **Turn on diagnostics**.

![](media/image21.jpg){width="3.3118055555555554in" height="4.395in"}In
the **Diagnostic** blade, make the following changes to configure
diagnostic logging.

For **Name**, enter a value for the diagnostic log configuration.

You can choose to store/process the data in different ways.

Select the option to **Archive to a storage account** to store logs to
an Azure Storage account. You use this option if you want to archive the
data that will be batch-processed later. If you select this option, you
must provide an Azure Storage account to save the logs to.

Select the option to **Stream to an event hub** to stream log data to an
Azure Event Hub. Most likely you will use this option if you have a
downstream processing pipeline to analyze incoming logs at real time.

Select the option to **Send to Log Analytics** to use the Azure Log
Analytics service to analyze the generated log data. If you select this
option, you must provide the details for the Operations Management Suite
workspace that you would use the perform log analysis.

Specify whether you want to get audit logs or request logs or both.

Specify the number of days for which the data must be retained.
Retention is only applicable if you are using Azure storage account to
archive log data.

Click **Save**.

## View diagnostic logs for your Data Lake 

There are two ways to view the log data for your Data Lake Store
account.

-   From the Data Lake Store account settings view

-   From the Azure Storage account where the data is stored

### 8.2.1 Using the Data Lake Store Settings View

From your Data Lake Store account **Settings** blade, click **Diagnostic
Logs**.

![](media/image22.jpg){width="6.5in" height="3.4895833333333335in"}

In the **Diagnostic Logs** blade, you should see the logs categorized by
**Audit Logs** and **Request Logs**.

Request logs capture every API request made on the Data Lake Store
account.

Audit Logs are like request Logs but provide a much more detailed
breakdown of the operations being performed on the Data Lake Store
account. For example, a single upload API call in request logs might
result in multiple \"Append\" operations in the audit logs.

To download the logs, click the **Download** link against each log
entry.

### 8.2.2 From the Azure Storage account that contains log data

Open the Azure Storage account blade associated with Data Lake Store for
logging, and then click Blobs. The **Blob service** blade lists two
containers.

The container **insights-logs-audit** contains the audit logs.

The container **insights-logs-requests** contains the request logs.

![](media/image23.jpg){width="6.5in" height="2.654166666666667in"}

Within these containers, the logs are stored under the following
structure.

![](media/image24.jpg){width="4.655972222222222in"
height="2.698611111111111in"}

## Understand the structure of the log data 

The audit and request logs are in a JSON format. In this section, we
look at the structure of JSON for request and audit logs.

### 8.3.1 Request Logs

Here\'s a sample entry in the JSON-formatted request log. Each blob has
one root object called *records* that contains an array of log objects.
